# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Luniva Joshi**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**PokeImage** is an android app that **Displays a Pokemon based on the user's query. Once the user has typed in a pokemon and pressed the "Search Pokemon" button, the app returns a picture of the pokemon, it's name, and it's type!**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **🎮🔍🧬**

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

The following STRETCH features are implemented:
